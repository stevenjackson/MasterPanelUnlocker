Leandog Color Combination Programming Challenge

T h e   C h a l l e n g e
You recently had a state of the art security system installed in your home. The master 
control panel requires a series of bi-colored chips to be placed end to end in a 
speci?c sequence in order to gain access. The security provider split up the chips and 
gave a random number to each of your family members. All of you must convene in 
order to assemble the chips and create the correct color combination.
The access panel has a channel for the security chips. On each end of the channel is 
a colored marker. Chips are placed end to end such that the adjacent colors match 
and the starting and ending chips are color matched to the corresponding markers. 
Write a program to see if the family has all the chips necessary to unlock the master 
control panel.

The input consists of a single line indicating the beginning and ending marker colors 
followed by a series of chip de?nitions. All lines consist of a pair of color indicators; 
you may use integers, strings, or characters to represent each color. For our example 
purposes, we will use strings.


O u t p u t
If the combination cannot be achieved by using all of the chips once and only once, 
then report “Cannot unlock master panel”. If the combination can be achieved, then 
print the chips in the order required to unlock the master control.
